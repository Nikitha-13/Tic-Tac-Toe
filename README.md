# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This Python script allows you to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against another player. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their respective symbols (X or O) until one player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or the game ends in a draw.

## Instructions:

* Run the script in a Python environment.
* Follow the on-screen prompts to input your moves.
* Players take turns entering their moves by inputting a number from 1 to 9, corresponding to the position on the board (as shown below):

  1 | 2 | 3
  
  4 | 5 | 6
  
  7 | 8 | 9
* The game will notify you of the outcome: whether X wins, O wins, or if it's a draw.
* You can play again by rerunning the script.

## Features:

* The script includes functions to print the current board, handle player moves, check for victory conditions, and determine if the game ends in a draw.
* The game continuously loops until there's a winner or a draw, allowing for multiple rounds of play.
* Players are prevented from making moves on already occupied spaces.


Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
